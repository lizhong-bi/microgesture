For ura project

Note that I have only uploaded the src folder of the entire project, which is comprised of if not most, all of the files that I have changed and added from the default folder that was generated by Android studio when I first started the project.

The entire project flows like this:
  The MainActivity.java file is the first file that would run when the application opens up and the corresponding layout for this would be landing_page.xml .
